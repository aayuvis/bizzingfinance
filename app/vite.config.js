/* The service worker is not an app module — it must land at the build root
   unhashed, or its scope is wrong. One inline plugin beats a dependency.

   The manifest and the icon have exactly the same problem and it bit us: Vite
   treated them as assets, hashed them and moved them into assets/, so their
   own relative fields resolved against THAT directory. On a project page at
   /bizzingfinance/ the manifest's start_url pointed at
   /bizzingfinance/assets/index.html and its icon at
   /bizzingfinance/assets/icon.svg — both 404. The app was fine; installing it
   to a home screen launched a dead page with no icon, and nothing in a
   root-served dev build could show you that. They now live in public/, which
   Vite copies verbatim to the build root and never rewrites. */
